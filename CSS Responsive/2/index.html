          The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits at an average
          distance of 384400 km (238900 mi), about 30 times the planet's
          diameter. The Moon always presents the same side to Earth, because
          gravitational pull has locked its rotation to the planet. This results
          in the lunar day of 29.5 days matching the lunar month. The Moon's
          gravitational pull – and to a lesser extent the Sun's – are the main
          drivers of the tides. The Moon is in geophysical terms a
          planetary-mass object or satellite planet. It has a mass that amounts
          to 1.2% of Earth's, and a diameter that is roughly one-quarter of
          Earth's or with 3,474 km (2,159 mi) about as wide as Australia.[17]
          Within the Solar System it is the most massive and largest satellite
          in relation to its parent planet, the fifth most massive and largest
          moon overall, and more massive and larger than all known dwarf
          planets.[18] Its surface gravity is about one sixth of Earth's, about
          half of that

        <h1>Saturn</h1>
        <p>
          Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the
          Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius
          of about nine-and-a-half times that of Earth. It has only one-eighth
          the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.
          Saturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core,
          surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer
          of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer
          layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its
          upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen
          layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field,
          which is weaker than Earth's, but which size. Saturn's magnetic field
          strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is
          generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features
          can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 kilometres per hour
          (1,100 miles per hour).

        <p>
          The sky is an unobstructed view upward from the surface of the Earth.
          It includes the atmosphere and outer space. It may also be considered
          a place between the ground and outer space, thus distinct from outer
          space. In the field of astronomy, the sky is also called the celestial
          sphere. This is an abstract sphere, concentric to the Earth, on which
          the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars appear to be drifting. The celestial
          sphere is conventionally divided into designated areas called
          constellations. Usually, the term sky informally refers to a
          perspective from the Earth's surface; however, the meaning and usage
          can vary. An observer on the surface of the Earth can see a small part
          of the sky, which resembles a dome (sometimes called the sky bowl)
          appearing flatter during the day than at night.[1] In some cases, such
          as in discussing the weather, the sky refers to only the lower, denser
          layers of the atmosphere. The daytime sky appears blue because air
