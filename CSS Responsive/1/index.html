          <h1>Saturn</h1>
          <p>
            Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in
            the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average
            radius of about nine-and-a-half times that of Earth. It has only
            one-eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more
            massive. Saturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky
            core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an
            intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and
            finally, a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to
            ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current
            within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to
            Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but
            which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's
            larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around
            one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally bland
            and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear.
            Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 kilometres per hour (1,100
            miles per hour). The planet has a prominent ring system, which is
            composed mainly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky
            debris and dust. At least 146 moons are known to orbit the planet,
            of which 63 are officially named; this does not include the hundreds
            of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the
            second largest in the Solar System, is larger (while less massive)
            than the planet Mercury and is the only moon in the Solar System to
            have a substantial atmosphere.

          <h1>Moon</h1>
          <p>
            The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits at an average
            distance of 384400 km (238900 mi), about 30 times the planet's
            diameter. The Moon always presents the same side to Earth, because
            gravitational pull has locked its rotation to the planet. This
            results in the lunar day of 29.5 days matching the lunar month. The
            Moon's gravitational pull and to a lesser extent the Sun's are the
            main drivers of the tides. The Moon is in geophysical terms a
            planetary-mass object or satellite planet. It has a mass that
            amounts to 1.2% of Earth's, and a diameter that is roughly
            one-quarter of Earth's or with 3,474 km (2,159 mi) about as wide as
            Australia. Within the Solar System it is the most massive and
            largest satellite in relation to its parent planet, the fifth most
            massive and largest moon overall, and more massive and larger than
            all known dwarf planets. Its surface gravity is about one sixth of
            Earth's, about half of that of Mars, and after Jupiter's moon Io the
            second highest among all Solar System moons. The body of the Moon is
            differentiated and terrestrial, with no significant hydrosphere,
            atmosphere, or magnetic field. It formed 4.51 billion years ago, not
            long after Earth's formation, out of the debris from a giant impact
            between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia. The
            lunar surface is covered in lunar dust and marked by mountains,
            impact craters, their ejecta, ray-like streaks and, mostly on the
            near side of the Moon, by dark maria ("seas"), which are plains of
            cooled magma. These maria formed when large impacts on the far side
            of the Moon heated up low lying layers of its crust on the near
            side. The Moon is, beside when passing through Earth's shadow during
            a lunar eclipse, always illuminated by the Sun, but from Earth the
            visible illumination shifts during its orbit, producing the lunar
            phases. The Moon is the brightest celestial object in Earth's night
            sky. This is mainly due to its large angular diameter, while the
            reflectance of the lunar surface is comparable to that of asphalt.
            The apparent size is nearly the same as that of the Sun, allowing it
            to cover the Sun almost completely during a total solar eclipse.
            From Earth about 59% of the lunar surface is visible over time due
            to cyclical shifts in perspective (libration), making parts of the
            far side of the Moon visible.
