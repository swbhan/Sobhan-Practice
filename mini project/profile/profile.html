        <h1><i>The Professor</i></h1>
        <p>
          The Professor , real name Sergio, mostly grew up in hospitals due to

          plans and organises the heist in the Royal Mint and the Bank of Spain.

          <p class="text" id="biography">
            The Professor , real name Sergio, mostly grew up in hospitals due to
            being a sick child . He leads the gang , and is the one who
            carefully plans and organises the heist in the Royal Mint and the
            Bank of Spain. He is sophisticated but nerdy . The idea of the first
            heist is to avenge his father , whose idea it originally was. His
            grandfather had fought against the fascists in Italy. He was the
            mastermind behind the plans of the two heists. He controlled the
            heist through a hiding outside the Royal Mint.The Professor falls in
            love with Raquel Murillo, a police investigator leading the case
            against the heist. Under the false identity of Salvador "Salva"
            Mart√≠n, he was able to get closer to the lead inspector assigned to
            the Royal Mint robbery, Raquel Murillo, and the pair eventually fell
            in love. Raquel then joins the gang by the name "Lisbon". He sleeps
            with her and when her mother finds out about his involvement with
            the heist, he attempts to poison her but pulls out at the last
            second, opting to take advantage of her poor memory and deleting the
            voicemail. The Professor spent years of his life meticulously
            planning the heist, and covered aspects that most people wouldn't
            think of. His tactic was to lead the police to several dead ends to
            buy more time for the money to be printed and the team to escape.
