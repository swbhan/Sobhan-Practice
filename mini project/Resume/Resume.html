              Having evolved and discovered hyperspace travel, the intelligent
              life of the "Star Wars" universe forms the original galactic
              republic. the jedi order, a group of peacekeepers with a
              connection to the force, is also established. but rogue jedi soon
              emerge, split from the order, and become the sith, who use the
              dark side of the force. powerful warriors known as the
              mandalorians also fight the jedi order. the mandalorian-jedi war
              devastates mandalore, their home world. despite this animosity, a
              mandalorian warrior named tarre vizsla is inducted into the jedi
              order and constructs the darksaber, a unique black-bladed
              lightsaber capable of slicing through anything, save beskar steel.
              The Darksaber also connects with the wielder on a subconscious
              level, becoming lighter or heavier based on the way its owner
              embraces or resists the connection. After Vizsla's death, the
              Darksaber passes through many hands and becomes a symbol of
              leadership. with the sith physics are less In order to properly
              obtain the Darksaber, however, one needs to defeat the previous
              owner in combat. After centuries of conflict, the Sith are
              seemingly wiped out in the Jedi-Sith War. In actuality, the sole
              survivor, Darth Bane, establishes the "rule of two." it dictates
              there can only be two sith at one time is a master and an
              apprentice. This prevents infighting among multiple Sith Lords,
              and allows the Sith to go undercover.
