            Having evolved and discovered hyperspace travel, the intelligent
            life of the "Star Wars" universe forms the original galactic
            republic. the jedi order, a group of peacekeepers with a connection
            to the force, is also established. but rogue jedi soon emerge, split
            from the order, and become the sith, who use the dark side of the
            force. powerful warriors known as the mandalorians also fight the
            jedi order. the mandalorian-jedi war devastates mandalore, their
            home world. despite this animosity, a mandalorian warrior named
            tarre vizsla is inducted into the jedi order and constructs the
            darksaber, a unique black-bladed lightsaber capable of slicing
            through anything, save beskar steel. The Darksaber also connects
            with the wielder on a subconscious level, becoming lighter or
            heavier based on the way its owner embraces or resists the
            connection. After Vizsla's death, the Darksaber passes through many
            hands and becomes a symbol of leadership. with the sith physics are
            less In order to properly obtain the Darksaber, however, one needs
            to defeat the previous owner in combat. After centuries of conflict,
            the Sith are seemingly wiped out in the Jedi-Sith War. In actuality,
            the sole survivor, Darth Bane, establishes the "rule of two." it
            dictates there can only be two sith at one time is a master and an
            apprentice. This prevents infighting among multiple Sith Lords, and
            allows the Sith to go undercover.
