      <h1>HTML</h1>
      <p>
        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language
        for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the
        meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
        technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
        languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a
        web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page
        semantically and originally included cues for its appearance. HTML
        elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
        images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into
        the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
        by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
        lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by
        tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as and directly introduce
        content into the page. Other tags such as and surround and provide
        information about document text and may include sub-element tags.
        Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the
        content of the page. HTML can embed programs written in a scripting
        language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of
        web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.
        The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and
        current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS
        over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known
        as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the
        element, together with JavaScript. History Development Photograph of Tim
        Berners-Lee in April 2009 Tim Berners-Lee in April 2009 In 1980,
        physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped
        ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In
        1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext
        system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server
        software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems
        engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding,
        but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes
        of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext
        is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4] The first publicly
        available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[5]
        first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7]
        It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple
        design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly
        influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language
        (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements
        still exist in HTML 4.[8] HTML is a markup language that web browsers
        use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into
        visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of
        HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be
        altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS.
        Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report
        TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features of early
        text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command
        developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing
        System) operating system. These formatting commands were derived from
        the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However,
        the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested
        annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with
        separate structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this
        direction with CSS.
