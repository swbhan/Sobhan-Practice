          <h2>Ocean</h2>
          <p>
            The ocean (also known as the sea or the world ocean) is a body of
            salt water that covers approximately 70.8% of the Earth and contains
            97% of Earth's water.The term ocean also refers to any of the large
            bodies of water into which the world ocean is conventionally
            divided. Distinct names are used to identify five different areas of
            the ocean: Pacific (the largest), Atlantic, Indian, Southern, and
            Arctic (the smallest).Seawater covers approximately 361,000,000 km2
            (139,000,000 sq mi) of the planet. The ocean is the primary
            component of the Earth's hydrosphere, and thus essential to life on
            Earth. The ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon
            cycle, and the water cycle by acting as a huge heat reservoir.
