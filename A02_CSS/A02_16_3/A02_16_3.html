        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation,
        including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content
        accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification
        of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share
        formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which
        reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable
        the .

          pages that share the file and its formatting .</span
        >Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present
        the same markup page in different styles for different rendering
        methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser
        or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has
        rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile
        device.

          In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and
          prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share
          documents.
          <span class="Text4">
            In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
            hypertext system.Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser
            and server software in late 1990.
          </span>
          That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau
          collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not
          formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee
          listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an
          encyclopedia is the first entry.The first publicly available
          description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",first mentioned
          on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.It describes 18
          elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML.
          Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by
          SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language
          (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements
          still exist in HTML 4.
