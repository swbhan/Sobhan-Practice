        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
        describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
        such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or
        XHTML).CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside
        HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of content
        and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation
        can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control
        in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple
        web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
        separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the
        structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the
        page load speed between the pages that share the file and its
        formatting.
