    <h1>River</h1>
    <p>
      A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater stream,
      flowing on the surface or inside caves towards another waterbody at a
      lower elevation, such as an ocean, sea, bay, lake, wetland, or another
      river. In some cases, a river flows into the ground or becomes dry at the
      end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can
      be referred to using names such as creek, brook, and rivulet. There are no
      official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic
      features,although in some countries or communities, a stream is defined by
      its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location;
      examples are "run" in some parts of the United States, "burn" in Scotland
      and Northeast England, and "beck" in Northern England. Sometimes a river
      is defined as being larger than a creek,but not always: the language is
      vague.
