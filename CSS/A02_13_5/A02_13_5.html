        Night (also described as nighttime, unconventionally spelled as "nite")
        is the period of ambient darkness from sunset to sunrise during each
        24-hour day, when the Sun is below the horizon. The exact time when
        night begins and ends depends on the location and varies throughout the
        year, based on factors such as season and latitude.

          A sea is a large body of salty water. There are particular seas and
          the sea. The sea commonly refers to the ocean, the wider body of
          seawater. Particular seas are either marginal seas, second-order
          sections of the oceanic sea (e.g. the Mediterranean Sea), or certain
          large, nearly landlocked, saltwater lakes (e.g. the Caspian Sea).

        A waterfall is a point in a river or stream where water flows over a
        vertical drop or a series of steep drops. Waterfalls also occur where
        meltwater drops over the edge of a tabular iceberg or ice shelf.
