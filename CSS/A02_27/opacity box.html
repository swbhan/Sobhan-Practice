      <h1>Opacity</h1>
      <p>
        Opacity is the measure of impenetrability to electromagnetic or other
        kinds of radiation, especially visible light. In radiative transfer, it
        describes the absorption and scattering of radiation in a medium, such
        as a plasma, dielectric, shielding material, glass, etc. An opaque
        object is neither transparent (allowing all light to pass through) nor
        translucent (allowing some light to pass through). When light strikes an
        interface between two substances, in general some may be reflected, some
        absorbed, some scattered, and the rest transmitted (also see
        refraction). Reflection can be diffuse, for example light reflecting off
        a white wall, or specular, for example light reflecting off a mirror. An
        opaque substance transmits no light, and therefore reflects, scatters,
        or absorbs all of it. Other categories of visual appearance, related to
        the perception of regular or diffuse reflection and transmission of
        light, have been organized under the concept of cesia in an order system
        with three variables, including opacity, transparency and translucency
        among the involved aspects. Both mirrors and carbon black are opaque.
        Opacity depends on the frequency of the light being considered.
