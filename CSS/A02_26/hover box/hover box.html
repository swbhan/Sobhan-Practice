        <p>
          The sky is an unobstructed view upward from the surface of the Earth.
          It includes the atmosphere and outer space. It may also be considered
          a place between the ground and outer space, thus distinct from outer
          space. In the field of astronomy, the sky is also called the celestial
          sphere. This is an abstract sphere, concentric to the Earth, on which
          the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars appear to be drifting. The celestial
          sphere is conventionally divided into designated areas called
          constellations.
